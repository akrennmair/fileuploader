README for fileuploader
=======================

In order to build fileuploader, you need the latest Go weekly snapshot (at the 
time of writing, weekly.2012-01-27) and the build tool gb, which you can
install in your Go system with the following command:

	goinstall code.google.com/p/go-gb/gb

In order to build fileuploader, simply run

	gb

on your command line and gb will automatically create a binary named 
fileuploader.

fileuploader comes with automated tests. You can run them the following way:

	gb -t

If everything works fine, you should see "PASS" on your terminal.

To run fileuploader, simply type

	./fileuploader

and fileuploader will run and bind to port 8000. Open http://localhost:8000/
to see the application user interface. Uploaded files will be stored in
the files subdirectory.
